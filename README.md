# Text-Mining-Facebook

Parenting in Peel is a Facebook page run by registered nurses in the Family Health division at the Region of Peel that supports parents of children ages 0 to 6 by posting tips and information, and interacting with page followers.

While it is possible to track the page’s ‘reach’ (number of page views, likes, messages, etc.), no clear strategy of how to increase user engagement exists. Using text mining to develop a methodology to analyze the content of the posts will help understand what topics and types of posts receive the most likes, comments, and shares, thereby improving the effectiveness of the Facebook page.

This report analyzes how text mining techniques such as topic identification, clustering and visualization contribute to the strategy of increasing engagement of the Parenting in Peel Facebook page.
